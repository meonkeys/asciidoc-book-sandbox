= üñ®Ô∏è Print This

Generate a book with https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/[Asciidoctor PDF].

Typesetting for print-on-demand printing is complex.
This helps.
Use this code as a starting point for your own print book.

The output is a PDF ready to print with Lulu.
Lulu is currently the only supported printer.
<<Patches welcome>> to resolve <<Issues,issue ad04>>.

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
cd book
./build.sh
----

If that worked, examine `book/print-this.pdf`.

== Testing

The build script above also serves as an automated acceptance test.
If the build completes without errors, this test passes.
Ignore warnings and less severe output.

The manual acceptance test is to upload the PDF to Lulu.
If Lulu accepts the PDF as valid, this test passes.
Ignore warnings and less severe output.

== Issues

Here's a brief summary of the stuff we are aware of and working on.

|===
|ID |Description |Status |Resolution Details

|ad02 |translate to any language besides English |OPEN |

We maintain our own issue list here so this repository is more useful on its own.
IDs start with `ad` to avoid conflicts with IDs that might be generated by some other issue tracker, should we choose one.
Completed items can be removed, just make sure to leave the last one so we don't skip IDs.
Don't apply specific AsciiDoc formatting (e.g. column widths), the default should be good enough.
Don't change spacing in the source, it is natural/uneven on purpose to optimize for proper diffs in source control history.

== Conventions

* pay attention to and follow the existing style
** standardize whenever possible and formalize conventions here
* source control
** commit early and often
** group logically related changes into single commits
*** consider future maintainers may wish to `git revert`: try to make that easy for them
** group a series of related changes in a branch
** squashing is OK
** before submitting patches:
*** ensure build passes
** commit log messages
*** the first line of a commit log message is very important: say precisely *what* change you made, save the *why* for the rest
*** use infinitive verb forms, e.g.¬†"add -q quiet option"
*** don't wrap body text

== ad06 detail

Asciidoctor-PDF does not yet support color emoji, and the fallback font with _some_ emoji is not comprehensive.
For what it's worth, I don't need nor want color emoji in this project, I'm just documenting why it currently works the way it does.

See:

* <https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/theme/fallback-font/#requirements>
